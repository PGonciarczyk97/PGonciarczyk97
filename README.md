- Hi, my name is Patrick Gonciarczyk, I have recently graduated form DePaul University my my Master in Applied Mathematics. 
I am currently looking for a career in data, business, or actualrial analytics and the programs that I am familiar with are as follows:
- Python
- C++
- Maple
- SAS
An example of analysis from. my SAS course shows how we draw inferences from a sample to a population of intrest:

a)	Specify the population and sample.

- A sample could be from two states in the United States and could be used to estimate income, living expenses, and population could be 100 from each state 

b)	Define at least one parameter and statistic of interest.

- A parameter would be the income of 100 different households per state and we could check the mean, median, and relationship between the two

c)	Describe the data and show an example of the data to be collected.

- State A: 41,000, 38,000, 96,000,...
- State B: 82,000, 76000, 21,000,...

d)	Specify the variable of interest.

- Variable of interest would be income

e)	Identify the purpose of the inference.

- The purpose would be to see if people are making enough money in each state to live comfortably there
